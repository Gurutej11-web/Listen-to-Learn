# Example Firebase Configuration

This file shows what your Firebase config should look like.
Replace with YOUR actual credentials from Firebase Console.

## Getting Your Firebase Config

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Click Settings (gear icon) ⚙️
4. Go to "Project Settings"
5. Scroll to "Your apps"
6. Click the web app (or create one)
7. Copy the configuration

## Example Configuration

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyD1234567890abcdefghijklmnop",
  authDomain: "listen-to-learn-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "listen-to-learn-project",
  storageBucket: "listen-to-learn-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
  appId: "1:123456789012:web:abcd1234efgh5678"
};
```

## Where to Put This

1. Open `public/js/firebase-config.js`
2. Replace the existing firebaseConfig object
3. Make sure apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc. match YOUR project
4. Save the file
5. The app will now connect to your Firebase project

## Important Notes

- **NEVER share your API key publicly**
- These are example values - use your own
- Each Firebase project has unique credentials
- The file is already in .gitignore (won't be committed)
- If you fork this project, you must add your own config

## Testing Your Config

After adding your config:

1. Start the local server
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for Firebase initialization message
4. Try signing up
5. Check Firebase Console to see if user appears

If you see errors about Firebase config, check:
- All values match your project exactly
- No typos in the credentials
- Firebase services are enabled
- You're using the correct project ID (not the number)

## For Contributors

If you're contributing to this project:

1. Don't include your real Firebase config in commits
2. Create a `.env.example` file
3. Document what credentials are needed
4. Each developer should create their own Firebase project
